# allNightLong
A web page project designed to mimic a basic "about this business" website. Will continue to add functionality and features as time passes. Heavily themed in the ~𝑅𝑒𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓌𝒶𝓋𝑒~ aesthetic.
This is my first venture into html/css/js and git usage. 
Changed naming on divs, and fixed position on "holder1" div. 7/29
Changed text housed within "holder1" div. 7/29
Fixed position on background image so that it does not repeat and remains static. 7.30
