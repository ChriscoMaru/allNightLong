# allNightLong
A web page project designed to mimic a basic "about this business" website. Will continue to add functionality and features as time passes. Heavily themed in the ~𝑅𝑒𝓉𝓇𝑜𝓌𝒶𝓋𝑒~ aesthetic.
This is my first venture into html/css/js and git usage. 
Changed naming on divs, and fixed position on "holder1" div.
Changed text housed within "holder1" div.
Fixed position on background image so that it does not repeat and remains static.
